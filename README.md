# Browserverse Code Repository

## Welcome to the Browserverse

Hey there! I'm Aaron, the creator of the [Browserverse](https://browserverse.cloud/).

Browserverse is a web extension for your browser that lets you see the universe of websites you've visited and explore your browsing history in a whole new way. And you get to see it every time you open a new tab! Browserverse is fun, free and always will be. You don't need an account, your data is your own, and is never sold or shared with anyone.

Anyway, thanks for dropping by and for checking out the extension. [Donate](https://buymeacoffee.com/browserverse) to fund continued upkeep and development and [share the extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/browserverse/insertrealbrowservercodehere) with your friends if you like what I'm building and want to see it grow. Don't hesitate to drop a note if you have ideas, improvements, bugs, or just want to say hi. ðŸ¤™
